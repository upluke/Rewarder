# Rewarder
Project Title: Rewarder App
Participants: Geoffrey Norman, Luke Lyu, May Deng, and Boris Marin
Description: 
We learned that one of the problems with distance learning is that there is a lack of structure. When school is in person, there are schedules and routines that give students structure for their time and attention. When students are at home, it can be difficult for them to focus with the many distractions available to them. Some students like the flexibility associated with distance learning. However, students need structure to learn effectively and they need to know what is expected of them. In addition, students need to be motivated to complete classwork and homework assignments.
This project contains a visual timer which allows students to gauge how much time they have left for working on their current assignment. The user inputs how much time the students will work, according to the appropriate grade level. The web app indicates how much time the students were focused on the classwork or homework assignment. Students earn points based on how many minutes they spent being focused on working on classwork or homework assignments. Students can accumulate enough points in order to obtain the following possible options: stickers, movie time, game time, and virtual dance party.
